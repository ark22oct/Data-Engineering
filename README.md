# COE848
Lab work for COE 848 (Fundamentals of Data Engineering) involving the creation of an Esports Database accomplished using SQL and VScode. Feel free to reference, but avoid copying.

Data engineering stands at the heart of crafting scalable software applications with efficiency. Robust data management strategies become imperative when dealing with substantial volumes of Big Data for processing. Delved into pertinent subjects, including entity-relation diagrams, relational databases, languages for data definition and manipulation, formats for structured data representations, the creation of innovative vocabularies, semi-structured data, and cutting-edge concepts within NoSQL databases.
